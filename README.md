# Advent_Of_Code.2023
Day9 - moving forward from here I will be competitive with respect to time, hopefully securing a place in the top 100

All of my advent of code solutions I have made this year (2023)

Trying to do this in Rust or Python, will likely end up using Java tho lol

PS, since problems are released at 5am GMT you wont be seeing the nicest solutions ever :)
